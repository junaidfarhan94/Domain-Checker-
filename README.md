============================================================


Future Enhancements
Smart GUI Integration: Incorporate a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter or PyQt to make the tool more user-friendly.
Customizable Themes: Allow users to choose different themes and fonts for the terminal output.
Additional Protocol Support: Extend reachability checks to include other protocols like FTP, SSH, etc.

### Additional Enhancements:

1. **Smart GUI (Future Work):**
   - Consider integrating a simple GUI using `Tkinter` or `PyQt` to make the tool accessible to users who prefer graphical interfaces.
   - The GUI could allow users to select the input file, start the domain check, and view results in a more interactive way.

2. **Custom Themes:**
   - Implement a feature where users can select different color schemes or fonts for the terminal output, adding a personal touch to their experience.

3. **Extended Protocol Support:**
   - Expand the script to check the reachability of domains using additional protocols like FTP, SSH, SMTP, etc., making it a more comprehensive network tool.

4. **Logging:**
   - Add an option to log all activities to a file, providing a detailed history of checks performed, which can be useful for auditing or troubleshooting.
